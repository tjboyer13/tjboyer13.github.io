Tederell J. Boyer, also known as “T.J.”, Im with the [Wildland Fire Management Research, Development, Application group](https://wfmrda.nwcg.gov/) as a Fire application Specislist. I primarily work with the Wildland Fire Decision Support System. I have been the Intelligence Coordinator for the Southern Area Coordination Center since 2017. I worked as a Fire Ecologist between 2011 through 2016 at Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. Originally from Fort Valley, GA, I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Soil Science from Fort Valley State University (FVSU), and a second Bachelor of Science degree in Forest Science from Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU).  I obtained firefighting experiences by working and completing a season with the Cherokee Hotshots, Asheville Hotshots, and through multiple fire assignments on engines. As a dispatcher I have completed multiple assignments in different geographic areas as an Intelligence Support (INTS), Expanded Dispatch Recorder (EDRC), and Expanded Dispatch Support Dispatcher (EDSD). I enjoy spending time with my wife, son, and daughter.
